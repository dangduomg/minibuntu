This is the minibuntu-rescue, the lightweight Ubuntu-based rescue tool

Open the applications menu or Application Finder (the icon with
magnifier) to find useful tools

Besides, these command line utilities are supported:
- chntpw (chntpw -i <samfile> for interactive mode)
- clamav (clamscan -r <dir> to scan, freshclam to update)
- clonezilla
- nwipe
